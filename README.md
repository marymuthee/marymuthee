# 👋 Hi, I'm Mary Muthee — Geospatial Data Scientist

I am a Geospatial Data Scientist passionate about exploring the potential of Earth Observation 🌍, AI, and Deep Learning. I enjoy transforming complex spatial data into meaningful insights 🗺️, building analytical workflows, and experimenting with modern machine learning techniques — from classical approaches to emerging geospatial foundation models.

Currently, I am advancing my skills through the **Copernicus Master in Digital Earth (Erasmus Mundus)**, where I am deepening my experience in geospatial technologies, analytical methods, and data-driven problem solving. Alongside my studies, I actively work on projects involving satellite imagery analysis, geospatial modeling, and end-to-end data exploration.

My work is driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a commitment to understanding how advanced analytical techniques can reveal patterns, support decision-making, and inspire innovative solutions.

I’m continuously building, refining, and sharing my journey — one notebook, one model, one map at a time.

I am always open to collaboration, research exchange, or new ideas.
