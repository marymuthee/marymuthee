👋 Hi, I'm Mary Muthee — Geospatial Data Scientist

I am a Geospatial Data Scientist passionate about exploring the potential of Earth Observation, AI, and Deep Learning. I enjoy transforming complex spatial data into meaningful insights, building analytical workflows, and experimenting with modern machine learning techniques — from classical approaches to emerging geospatial foundation models.

I am currently advancing my skills through the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth (Erasmus Mundus Programme), a multidisciplinary journey across Europe that strengthens my expertise in geoinformatics, Earth observation, data science, and advanced analytical methods. Alongside my studies, I actively work on projects involving satellite imagery analysis, geospatial modeling, and end-to-end data exploration.

My work is driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a commitment to understanding how advanced data techniques can reveal meaningful patterns, support informed decision-making, and inspire innovative solutions. I’m continuously building, refining, and sharing my journey — one notebook, one model, one map at a time.

I am always open to collaboration, research exchange, or new ideas.
Feel free to connect!
