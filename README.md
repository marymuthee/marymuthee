# 👋 Hi, I'm Mary Muthee, Geospatial Data Scientist

I am a Geospatial Data Scientist exploring the potential of geospatial, Earth Observation 🌍, AI, and Deep Learning. I enjoy transforming  spatial data into meaningful insights 🗺️, building analytical workflows, and experimenting with modern machine learning techniques  from classical approaches to emerging geospatial AI models.

Currently, I am advancing my skills through the **Copernicus Master in Digital Earth (Erasmus Mundus)**, where I am building my experience in geospatial technologies, analytical methods, and data-driven problem solving. Alongside my studies, I actively work on projects involving satellite imagery analysis, geospatial modeling, and end-to-end data exploration.

I am always open to collaboration, research exchange, or new ideas.
